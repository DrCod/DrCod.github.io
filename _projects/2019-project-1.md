Current Automatic Speech Recognition systems are biased towards fluent speech and lack interpretability. They fail at understanding and transcribing stuttering in a stuttered speech. With my project,I developed a deep learning framework to automatically detect segments of stuttering in an input speech. Future direction for this project will be to extend the work in this project, with the goal of developing a more inclusive ASR system for people with speech disfluencies.

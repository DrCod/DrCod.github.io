Current ASRs are biased towards fluent speech and lack interpretability. They fail at understanding and transcribing stuttering in a stuttered speech. With my project,I developed a deep learning pipeline to automatically detect and clip stuttered segments of an audio and output an understandable and fluent transcript. My future direction for this project is to build an ASR application to help people with speech dysfluencies.

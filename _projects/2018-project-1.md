 Aiming to obtain accurate concentration estimates of metabolites present in any segment of the brain tissue, it is not clear if metabolite signals can be quantified at all. In this paper,we present a end-to-end convolutional neural network that is trained on simulated MRS signals. An output regression layer consisting of 22 metabolites of which 1 is a macromolecule, gives a 22-dimensional output vector of concentration values of each metabolite basis set

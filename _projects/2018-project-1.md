 Aiming to obtain an accurate estimation of the concentration of metabolites present in any segment of the brain tissue, metabolite signals quantification still remain a challenging task. In this project,I trained convolutional neural networks on simulated magnetic resonance spectroscopy signals to predict the concentration of unseen metabolites.

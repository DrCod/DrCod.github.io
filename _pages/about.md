I study medicine at the University for Development Studies School of Medicine situated in Tamale,Ghana. I am interested in A.I with focus on machine learning, computer vision,natural language processing,speech recognition, reinforcement learning and meta-learning. My research question is situated at the intersection of A.I and health,and the NLP and Speech Recognition challenges arising from leveraging A.I in under-resourced and underrepresented settings. 

I enjoy having coffee chats,playing chess,running and reading.

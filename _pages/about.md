I am a clinical-year medical student at the University for Development Studies School of Medicine situated in Tamale,Ghana. Before medicine, I spent a year studying physics at the University of Ghana,Legon.Outside of medical school, I am interested in AI with focus on deep machine learning , reinforcement learning,computer vision, causal inference and meta-learning. In my spare time, I like to soak my curiosity in neuroscience (with hopes of understanding the brain-mind complex from an evolutionary standpoint) and quantum mechanics, with ideas exploring the layers bounding time, and the fabric of space-time. I am a FIDE approved chess player and I love to play chess when I find time.
